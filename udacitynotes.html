        <p>Actually, before I begin my first assingment, I want to share with you, a little bit, about me. I live and work as a server in Indianapolis, IN. I graduated from college almost 6 years ago now, with a Bachelor of the Arts, in Theatre. Upon graduation, I rose to the upper eschelon in regional theatre production, <em>primarily stage management</em>, but I struggled to make ends meet working in the arts full-time. Slowly, I exited the theatre to work full time in the service industry so I could provide for my well-being on my own. However, I still want more from life, and I realize waiting tables won't get me there. Plus, it's not an easy lifestyle, always working nights, weekends, holidays, etc. I am taking this class so I may gain a foundation to build a career as a front-end web developer, living and working, in Indianapolis, IN. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to tell you a little bit about myself.</p>
        On Wednesday, March 1st, 2017, I formally began my <em>Intro to Programming Nanodegree</em> via <b>Udacity</b>. My first project for this class is to develop a webpage with notes on new concepts I learned such as <i>how the web works</i> and how tags are used to structure and create syntax within a html file.</p>

        <h1>Important Concepts</h1>

        <p><b>The World Wide Web, How it Works, and HTML:</b></p>

        Components of the web include: <b>the user, you and your computer running a web browser</b> such as Chrome (which is what I prefer), Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer, <b>the Internet, and servers</b> (computers like yours, but instead of browsing files, they are optimized for hosting files).

        <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is the basis, or foundation, for almost every webpage; it can include documents, images, videos, etc. HTML is the glue of connectivity that creates the "web" in which webpages are connected, or linked, by hyperlinks, making the web, "weblike." I was surprised to learn that <b> there are some 30 billion pages on world wide web. </b> Talk about a web that could be strung, with so many pages linking to each other.</p>

        Furthermore, HTML is made up of:
            <li>text content, or <em>what you see</em></li>
            <li>markup, or <em>what it looks like</em></li>
            <li>linkes to other pages, or <em>hyperlinks</em></li>
            <li>references to other documents, such as <em>images, videos, etc.</em></li>

        <p>Doing some research, I discovered this website to <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">validate your HTML code.</a></p>

        <p>Lastly, while Atom is the preferred text editor by Udacity, I have been using and become comfortable with Sublime Text as my text editor for coding and programming in the short month that I've been learning how to code on my own.


        <p><b>Tags, Elements, and Whitespace:</b></p>

        <p>Computers interpret language literally, so it makes sense that computer programming languages are designed to limit ambiguity. In HTML markup, tags typically bookmark the content of an element with an opening and closing tag. These tags help computers interpret your HTML with more specificity, giving your webpage more structure, and design. Tags can be used to bold, italicize, or underline words of text, for example.

        Inline v. block elements: inline elements stop the line of code where at the incline element is placed, i.e. a line break, thus causing the remainder of the code, with

        Click <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAgs/">here</a> for an HTML Element Reference table in which HTML tags are ordered alphabetically, contain a description, and a note as to if that tag is supported by the current version of HTML, HTML 5. </p>
