    <h1>Important Concepts</h1>
    <p>Today, I formally began my <em>Intro to Programming Nanodegree</em><br> via <b>Udacity</b>. My first project for this class is <b>to develop</b> my webpage with
    <br>notes on new concepts I learned such as<br><i>how the web works</i> and how tags are used to structure and create syntax within a html file.

    <p>I am a front-end web developer in Indianapolis, IN</p>
