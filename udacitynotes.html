    <h1>Important Concepts</h1>

    <p><b>How the Webs Works:</b></p>

    <p>Today, I formally began my <em>Intro to Programming Nanodegree</em> via <b>Udacity</b>. My first project for this class is to develop a webpage with
    notes on new concepts I learned such as <i>how the web works</i> and how tags are used to structure and create syntax within a html file.

    <p><b>The World Wide Web and HTML:</b></p>

    Components of the web include: <b>the user, you and your computer running a web browser</b> such as Chrome (which is what I prefer), Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer, <b>the Internet, and servers</b> (computers like yours, but instead of browsing files, they are optimized for hosting files).

    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is the basis, or foundation, for almost every webpage; it can include documents, images, videos, etc. HTML is the glue of connectivity that creates the "web" in which webpages are connected, or linked, by hyperlinks, making the web, "weblike." I was surprised to learn that there are some 30 billion pages on world wide web. Talk about a web that could be strung, with so many pages linking to each other.</p>

    Furthermore, HTML is made up of:
        <li>text content, or <i>what you see</i></li>
        <li>markup, or <i>what it looks like</i></li>
        <li>linkes to other pages, or <i>hyperlinks</i></li>
        <li>references to other documents, such as <i>images, videos, etc.</i></li>

    <p>Doing some research, I discovered this website to <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">validate your HTML code.</a>

    <h2> About Me: </h2>

    <p>I live and work as a waiter in Indianapolis, IN. I graduated from college almost 6 years ago now, with a Bachelor of the Arts, in Theatre. Upon graduation, I rose to the upper eschelon in regional theatre (production, <em>primarily stage management</em>), but I struggled to make ends meet working in the arts full-time. Slowly, I exited the industry to work full time in the service industry so I could actually afford to pay my bills on my own (eg., I live by myself and rely on myself to provide for my well-being). However, the restaurant industry can be a tough way to earn a living as well. And, primarily, learning growth is stagnant. Once you know the basics, all you need to do is execute everyday. It isn't challenging, intellectually. Plus, no PTO, vacation time, or benefits are available unless I want to involve myself in restaurant management, which I've avoided to do because it's a black hole, I've heard. I digress. I am taking this class so I may gain a foundation to build a career as a front-end web developer, living and working, in Indianapolis, IN</p>
