        <p>I graduated from college almost 6 years ago with a Bachelor of the Arts, in Theatre. After graduation I worked in regional theatre production, until I left the arts to work full time in the restaurant service industry. After a few years, however, waiting tables won't get me where I want to be, and with that realization, I've begun my adventure into the field of coding and programming. Udacity was recommened to me from by a personal friend, Michael Lucero, who is currently enrolled in your Front-End Nanodegree, and I look forward to beginning my education with you. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to tell you a little bit about myself.</p>

        <h1>Important Concepts</h1>

        <p><b>The World Wide Web, How it Works, and HTML:</b></p>

        The Internet was created in the early 1990s, and has some 30 billion webpages at this time; which, if I'm being completely honest, surprised me quite a bit. Components of the web include: <b>the user, you and your computer running a web browser</b> such as Chrome (which is what I prefer), Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer, <b>the Internet, and servers</b> (computers like yours, but instead of browsing files, they are optimized for hosting files).

        <p>HTML stands for <em>HyperText Markup Language</em> and it is the basis, or foundation, for almost every webpage; it can include documents, images, videos, etc. HTML is the glue of connectivity that creates the "web" in which webpages are connected, or linked, by hyperlinks, making the web, "weblike." I was surprised to learn that <b> there are some 30 billion pages on world wide web. </b> Talk about the web that could be strung, with so many pages linking to each other.</p>

        Furthermore, HTML is made up of:
            <li>text content, or <em>what you see</em></li>
            <li>markup, or <em>what it looks like</em></li>
            <li>linkes to other pages, or <em>hyperlinks</em></li>
            <li>references to other documents, such as <em>images, videos, etc.</em></li>

        <p>To troubleshoot issues you may experience with your HTML code, check out this website to <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">validate your HTML code.</a></p>

        <p><b>Tags, Elements, and Whitespace:</b></p>

        <p>Computers interpret language literally, so it makes sense that computer programming languages are designed to limit ambiguity. In HTML markup, tags typically bookmark the content of an element with an opening and closing tag. These tags help computers interpret your HTML with more specificity, giving your webpage more structure, and design. Tags can be used to bold, italicize, or underline words of text, for example.

        Inline v. block elements: Whitespace that exists within inline code results into a single spaced displayed in the browser, such as was examplafied with the line break tag,

        <br>
        <br>

        Click <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAgs/">here</a> for an HTML Element Reference table in which HTML tags are ordered alphabetically, contain a description, and a note as to if that tag is supported by the current version of HTML, HTML 5. </p> Furthermore, the anchor tag attribute was best drawn up by Scott, and I found this example very teachable because this anchor tag creates the hyperlink, or link, demonstrating the power of the connectivity of the web with such a simple line of code:
        <img class="img-responsive" src="images/attr.jpg" height="75%" width="75%">

        <br>

        And whitespace refers to the space between code on the same or seperate lines that, because text is renedered inline

        <p>Lastly, while Atom is the preferred text editor by Udacity, I have been using and become comfortable with Sublime Text as my text editor for coding and programming in the short month that I've been learning how to code on my own.</p>
